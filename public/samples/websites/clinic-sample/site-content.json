Persistent Tooth Pain\nIf you have a toothache that lasts more than a day or two, it could indicate a cavity, infection, or cracked tooth that needs immediate attention.\n\n## 2. Bleeding Gums\nGums that bleed when you brush or floss may be a sign of gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). Early treatment can prevent tooth loss.\n\n## 3. Sensitivity to Hot or Cold\nSudden sensitivity could mean enamel erosion, a cavity, or an exposed root surface that requires professional evaluation.\n\n## 4. Bad Breath That Won't Go Away\nChronic bad breath (halitosis) can be caused by gum disease, cavities, or other oral infections that need treatment.\n\n## 5. Visible Changes\nAny lumps, white patches, sores, or discoloration in your mouth should be examined promptly to rule out serious conditions.",

      "content": "Everyone wants a brighter smile, but with so many options available, it's hard to know what actually works.\n\n## Professional vs. Over-the-Counter\nProfessional whitening at a dental clinic uses higher concentrations of bleaching agents and custom-fitted trays, delivering faster and more dramatic results than store-bought kits.\n\n## Home Remedies: Fact or Fiction?\n- **Baking soda**: Mildly effective but can damage enamel with overuse\n- **Oil pulling**: No scientific evidence for whitening\n- **Activated charcoal**: Can actually scratch and damage enamel\n- **Strawberries**: Malic acid provides negligible whitening\n\n## What Actually Works\n1. Professional in-office whitening (best results)\n2. Custom take-home trays from your dentist\n3. Whitening toothpaste (for maintenance only)\n\n## Maintaining Your Results\nAvoid staining foods and drinks like coffee, tea, and red wine for 48 hours after treatment. Use a straw when possible and maintain regular brushing habits.",
